--------- Steps Taken to Complete the Task ---------

1. Understanding Structure: Initially, I meticulously reviewed all components and files to understand the structure comprehensively. With that, I initiated a new React app named "Dashboard" and imported all essential components and files. Despite some CSS files being obscured or removed, I endeavored to replicate the design as closely as possible as provided in the PNG file.

2. Folder Structure:i tried my best to follow the folder structure, but i also wanted to make it easier to understand, what the folders are and what they are for!. So i tried my best to make it look easier and optimized.

3. Code Optimization: I embarked on the codebase to enhance cleanliness, simplicity, and efficiency. Due time constraints limited I haven't done it completely.

--------- Unused Dependencies ---------

1. Exclusion of react-helmet-async: This dependency was omitted due to encountered issues, which hindered proper rendering and resulted in internal browser errors.

2. Elimination of react-simplebar: I opted to remove react-simplebar (SimplebarReactClient) as its inclusion posed challenges in positioning the "upgrade to plan" card within Navbar.js and impeded smooth scrolling functionality.

--- Additional Notes ---

1. Routing Approach: As per instructions, I utilized <a> tags instead of a router implementation.

2. Location Handling: In lieu of useLocation, I utilized "window.location.href;" to retrieve current URL information.

3. Incomplete Elements: Due to time constraints, certain aspects such as the removal of scrollbar and addition of hover effects to Sidebar/Navbar, and other things are not done.

4. Background color: Efforts were made to replicate the background color of the TopBar.

In summary, I strived to meticulously complete the assignment while aiming for perfection within the given constraints. Despite not achieving 100% completion, the project reflects a diligent effort to meet the objectives outlined.
